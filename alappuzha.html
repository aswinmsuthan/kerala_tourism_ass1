                        <p>Also called ‘Dwarka of the South’, Ambalapuzha Sree Krishna Temple is said to be built between 15th – 17th century AD. Dedicated to Lord Krishna, the temple is one of the oldest shrines in the region. The main deity in the temple is Parthasarathi, which is another name for Lord Krishna. The idol is carved out of black granite and has a conch (shankh) in the left hand and holds a whip in right hand. The temple has traditional Kerala style architecture and is famous for its unique prasad – Pal Payasam, a milk and rice pudding.</p>

This black granite statue that is believed to be dating back to the 11th century was abandoned in a nearby stream and recovered by a British official named Sir Robert Bristow in 1930s. It is said that the statue has healing powers and anybody who touches the feet of the statue gets rid of their illness.</p>

                            <p>Boasting the quintessential architectural style of Kerala, Krishnapuram Palace is a gorgeous 18th-century affair. Dormer windows, a gabled roof and narrow corridors lend it uniqueness. Once the property of Maharaja Marthanda Varma of Travancore, this palace (also includes a museum) is currently under the Kerala State Department of Archaeology’s care. Soak in the serenity of the large pond inside the palace, which is believed to conceal underground escape paths from enemies. Spare some time to admire a Bible written in Sanskrit, a double-edged sword called Kayamkulam Val, and the stunning 154 sq. ft. Gajendra Moksham mural.</p>
